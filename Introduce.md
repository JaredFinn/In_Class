## **_Experience_**
I first started studying computer science when I came to college. I have always been interested but never got into it. 
Computer Science is my major here at New Paltz, so I have been on track with those classes, so far, I have taken 
Computer Science 1,2, and 3, Assembly Language, discrete math, Operating Systems, and software engineering, to name the most relevant. 
A lot of the programs I have written are usually to test out skills and build a little bit each time, from little games to 
generators for things in real life I might need. The largest project I have been a part of was in software engineering class, my group and I 
created a video game software built in the Unreal Engine. Was a huge learning experience, and a big introduction into working in a group 
towards one objective and bringing all our various skills together.

## **_Future_**
I was recommended this course by fellow CS majors. Currently I am not sure what field of computer science I would like to end up in and am trying 
to explore the waters. Web Programming is a skill I have attempted to teach myself before and was interested and enjoyed it but was in a time I was 
not focused on learning. This class will give me that structure to build on what I have already learned and guide me to build apps and whatever else 
that is I have been hoping to do eventually. Building a portfolio as my own web page is a big goal of mine as well so this will give me the skills 
to do that the way I want and really show off skills to get myself out there.
